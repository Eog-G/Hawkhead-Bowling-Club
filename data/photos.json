        "description": "On Saturday 3rd August, over 60 members and friends enjoyed our second annual “Bowl, BBQ and Fun Night” to raise funds for the Club’s 2021 Centenary. The weather didn’t match last year’s sunshine, but everyone still played a few ends before the rain came. Our dedicated BBQ team served over 100 people, and the night ended with games, raffles, a quiz, and prizes for the first visitor to get a “chalker” and the top rink. Thank you to everyone who came and helped make it a great success!",

Claire McGroarty, daughter of Gents' President John McGroarty, delivered the silver jack and impressively got a toucher with her first ever bowl! The flag was raised by Honorary President Matt Paul and Executive Chair Moira Bryan. Afterwards, everyone enjoyed hospitality in the hall. The opening dance on Saturday 14th featured vocalist Andy Sommers and a fish supper. The Centenary Group raffle draw raised £111, with John Forbes winning 6 bottles of spirits — congratulations, and thank you to everyone who bought tickets!",
